In this task the input file is solar.txt and is information that inlcudes details about different space objects and space discoveries.  The programs accomplish several different pattern matches, with the focus being on filtering the file and making small changes to specific information in the file.  

1. The first filter applied "Filter1.pl" will print all records in solar.txt that do not have a discoverer and corresponds to Output1-1. 

2. The second filer applied "Filter2.pl" will print all records after erasing the second field and corresponds to Output2-1.

3. The third filter applied "Filter3.pl" will print all records that have a negative orbital period and corresponds to Output3-1.

4. The fourth filter applied "Filter4.pl" will print all records that have objects that were discovered by Voyager2 and corresponds to Output4-1.

5.  The fifth filter applied "Filter5.pl" will print all records after changing their orbital periods from days into seconds and corresponds to Output5-1.
